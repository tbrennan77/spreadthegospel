          <p>My name is Froi Medina born in Baguio City, Philippines. At the age of 11 years old my family and I moved to Los Angeles California. I got saved when I was 15 years old and started preaching at 15 years old: I was the first person who got saved in our entire family. Now my parents and sisters are now saved and currently serving in the ministry. Some of my relatives are are currently active in in a Baptist church. At the age of 17 years old God called me to be a missionary in Baguio City. I was also a youth pastor of our church at 17 years old. I went to Bible school in my young adult years and graduated in 2003. In March 19,2006 we had our first service in Baguio City, Philippines with an attendance of 350 and 32 baptized.</p>
          <p>We reach Baguio City and surrounding areas. We have helped plant the Lighthouse Bible Baptist Church of Urayon Caba, La Union and Lighthouse Bible Baptist Church of Maliwalo Tarlac City.</p>
          <p>We are praying to start an orphanage—we currently have 3 orphans in our church—and a Christian school—mainly for those who cannot afford to go to school.</p>
